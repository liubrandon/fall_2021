    "\n",
    "One of the **most important** things to do when programming is to add *comments* to your scripts so that anyone [(including yourself, in the future)](https://dev.to/sunnysingh/writing-code-for-your-future-self-3da2) looking at them later will be able to better understand them. You can check out [this guide](https://realpython.com/python-comments-guide/) for writing effective comments in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In python, you can use the `#` symbol to make comments. Anything on a line to the right of the `#` will be a comment, and will not be run as code\n",
    "\n",
    "Try adding comments to your `print.py` script similar to this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# this line of code prints out a first line of text\n",
    "print('hi, this is your computer speaking')\n",
    "\n",
    "# this line of code prints out a second line of text\n",
    "print('i can run a lot of python code')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run your script, you should see exactly the same output as before. Notice, we added extra lines with white space -- python doesn't care about these though. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Commenting out lines of code\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments are **super useful** for making notes for yourself and others! One other thing about comments is that you can also comment out lines with actual python code in them, and these lines will be ignored when you run the script. For example, if you run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# this line of code prints out a first line of text\n",
    "print('hi, this is your computer speaking')\n",

    "#### Commenting out big chunks\n",

    "## 3. Assigning & updating variables\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn about variables, let's make a new script in the `bootcamp_scripts` folder called `variables.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are variables? \n",
    "Variables are ways to save things in your code. One way to think of them is as little boxes you can put other things into, and you can use the name of the box wherever you want in your code to refer to what's inside the box. Any time you work with variables in python, it is important to be able to think of the **variable name** as what refers to **what is actually stored in the variable**. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assigning variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables in python are always assigned with **a single equals sign**: `=`\n",
    "Let's check this out by adding the following code to `variables.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "firstname = 'Paul'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What we've done here is assigned `'Paul'` to the variable name `firstname`. So, we can think of `firstname` as the box, and `'Paul'` as what is inside the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we run `variables.py`, however, nothing comes out! Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "One key thing to remember is that **assigning variables produces no output**. So, we've saved `'Paul'` to the variable `firstname`, but we haven't told python to print anything out for us. We have to add a print statement for that. We can add some comments on each line too to remember how this works:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# assign the variable\n",
    "firstname = 'Paul'\n",
    "\n",
    "# print out the contents of the variable\n",
    "print(firstname)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, now if we run the script, we see:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "$ python variables.py \n",
    "Paul\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Great, now we have output! We can think about using `print()` with variables as printing out for us *what is inside the box* after we tell python which box we want to print out. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variable naming conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few rules for naming variables when we assign them:\n",
    " * They can't start with numbers \n",
    " * They can't have spaces in them\n",
    " \n",
    "Rules aside, one very useful convention is to use all lowercase letters in variable naming, and to separate each word with an underscore (`_`). \n",
    "\n",
    "For example: `my_new_variable` or `birthday_year`\n",
    " \n",
    "Check out the [PEP 8 guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#method-names-and-instance-variables) for more info on style in creating variable names. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Updating variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Updating variables is very similar to assigning them initially. The only difference is that there is an existing value stored in that variable, and you replace it. You can think of this as finding a box, and replacing what is inside it. When you do this, the prior information stored inside the variable (inside the box) is deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we run the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "variable_a = 'this is variable a'\n",
    "print(variable_a)\n",
    "variable_a = 'this is variable b'\n",
    "print(variable_a)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We get different a different printout when we **update** (or 're-assign') `variable_a`:\n",
    "```console\n",
    "$ python integers_floats.py \n",
    "this is variable a\n",
    "this is variable b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can update variables as many times as we want, but it is important to keep in mind that we lose the prior value stored in a variable when we reassign it. So, if we need to store more information, we often need multiple variables at the same time. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variable errors\n",
    "\n",
    "One problem you might hit a lot is if you misspell a variable name. For example, try updating your `variables.py` script to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# assign the variable\n",
    "first_name = 'Paul'\n",
    "\n",
    "# print out the contents of the variable (but we misspelled it)\n",
    "print(firstname)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when you run the script, you'll see: \n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "$ python variables.py \n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"variables.py\", line 2, in <module>\n",
    "    print(firstname)\n",
    "NameError: name 'firstname' is not defined\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is telling us that it is *looking* for the variable called 'firstname' in the print statement, but it couldn't find it! That's because it is 'not defined', indicating that we never assigned a variable with that name. If you see this error, you'll know to check your variable names to make sure you've assigned the variable you want to work with. "

    "#### Order of operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like a calculator, python obeys order of operations conventions on which types of math equations are evaluated first. The acronym [PEMDAS](https://thehelloworldprogram.com/python/python-operators-order-precedence/) indicates that python will evaluate math in this order:\n",

    "### Type conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, we'll want to convert integers to floats ourselves, and vice versa. This is called *type conversion*. We can do so by using `int()` to convert to integer, and `float()` to convert to float. For example:\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "However, things are a bit different if we convert a float to an integer, then print:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_float_2 = 2.777\n",
    "my_int_2 = int(my_float_2)\n",

    "```console\n",
    "$ python integers_floats.py \n",
    "2\n",
